# Gutenberg Block Static Example

This WordPress plugin is an example of a static Gutenberg block. It can be added to a post within the Gutenberg editor but its contents cannot be modified. This plugin was written as part of a[Gutenberg blocks tutorial](https://modularwp.com/how-to-build-gutenberg-blocks/) for [ModularWP](https://modularwp.com/).
